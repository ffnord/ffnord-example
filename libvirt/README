# Automagically Host Setup

Helper scripts to automagically setup some hosts from the ffnord community example.
The created hosts will install git and puppet and start configurating itself
with the ffnord-puppet-gateway manifests. You can manipulate the used
manifests in the 'machines' subdir. 

Details for the installed debian wheezy can be configured in the 'debian_preseed.cfg'.
Commands executed during postinstall and firstboot can be manipulated in the
corresspondings scripts.

## Requirements

* libvirtd (with: xen or kvm hypervisor)
* darkhttpd

## Known Problems / TODO

* After debian bootstrap you have to stop created machines and start it again.

* Replace icvpn,icvpn-meta and fastd key repos with community example once.

## Example 

```
sudo ./build-libvirt -m gc-gw0 gc-gw1
```
